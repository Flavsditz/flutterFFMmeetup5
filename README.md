# Meetup 5

We split into 4 groups of 3 or 4 people and tried to bring the following design into life in the time of the meetup.

## Design

![Dribble Design Used](https://cdn.dribbble.com/users/345970/screenshots/6518747/podcast.png)

This design was taken from [dribbble](https://dribbble.com/shots/6518747-Podcast-App-Exploration) and was made by [Ghani Pradita](https://dribbble.com/ghanipradita).


## Organization
The groups were organized as follow (apologizing in advance for my ASCII Art skills):

```bash
 --------       --------
 |  G3  |       |  G2  |
 --------       --------


 --------       --------
 |  G4  |       |  G1  |
 --------       --------


     ----------------
        Projection
```

As soon as each group uploads their part you can check them out. Each folder should contain a Flutter project that can be run sepparattely.

Have fun!
